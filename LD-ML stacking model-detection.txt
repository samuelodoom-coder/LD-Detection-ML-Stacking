Learning Difficulty Detection using Machine Learning

Overview
This project proposes a Machine Learning-based framework for early identification of Learning Difficulties (LDs) among basic school learners in Ghana. 
It integrates psychometric, behavioral, and demographic features with a stacking ensemble (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression) to achieve high accuracy while remaining interpretable.

Dataset
- Source: School-based data (e.g., 2021–2023 or 2022–2024).  
- Target: 'LD_Risk_Label' (Low, Moderate, High).  
- Features: Psychometric scores (e.g., Working Memory, Rapid Naming, ADHD), demographics, reading observations, etc.  
⚠️ Raw data is not included due to ethics/privacy.

Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- SVM (RBF, 'probability=True')
- Stacking Ensemble (final model)

Key Practices
- Stratified 80/20 split
- SMOTE applied only to the training set
- One-hot encoding for categoricals
- Standardization for numericals (used by LR/SVM)
- 5-fold CV for tuning/validation
- MLflow experiment tracking

Quickstart
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   - Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      - Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

Train (point to your CSV file & target column)
python src/train.py --data data/ld_dataset.csv --target LD_Risk_Label

Evaluate (generates reports and plots in results/)
python src/evaluate.py --data data/ld_dataset.csv --target LD_Risk_Label
